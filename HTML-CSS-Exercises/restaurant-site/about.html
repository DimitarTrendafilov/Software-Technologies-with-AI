            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Harbor Street Kitchen began as a small twelve-seat cafe in 2005. We set out to serve honest coastal cooking with the freshest ingredients we could source from our neighbors and fishermen.</p>
            <p>Today we are still family-owned, still greeting guests by name, and still crafting dishes that let the ingredients shine.</p>
